Mi Box 3 Enhanced (MDZ-18-AA) internationalization, Gapps and GappsTV (AndroidTV)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Currently this repo contains translations for the firmware version 1.5.16**

This is the compilation for making Mi Box 3 Enhanced a multilingual device - let's do it together.
There are corresponding Android strings files and graphics inside the directories starting from the root dir:
 - app
 - framework
 - priv-app
 - vendor

To add your language to the next package for device modification you can fork this repo and translate the needed apps. You can see how it's done for Russian and do the same for your own language or the language you speak. Don't forget that some apps not only have strings, but also some drawable resources to translate (again, look how's Russian translation done)
After you finish translation you can go for a PR.

I have also set a translation portal for making your efforts easier (tastes differ and some of you may think it would be easier to translate the files via web-interface instead of doing it via .xml translation). You can find it here: http://weblate.moneyseeker.ru/projects/mibox-3-enhanced-mdz-18-aa/. Choose the way of translation you like.# mdz18aa_int
